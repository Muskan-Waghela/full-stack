        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
